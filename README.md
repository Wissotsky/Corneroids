# Corneroids

This project is a fan-made revival and reverse engineering effort of the game Corneroids. The goal is to make it buildable with modern tools and frameworks, and to make it playable on modern systems.

## Current Status

- Crudely ported from xna 3.1 to monogame 4
- The project currently compiles successfully.
- **The game is unable to load the assets at this stage.**
- Work is ongoing to figure out and unpack the existing assets.

## How to Build

1. Open the solution file [`Corneroids.sln`] in Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution using the [`Debug`] or [`Release`] configuration.
